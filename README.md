## Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) shapes an organization of objects that can interface and share information
with different devices using sensors, computer programs, and other innovations
without human intervention. IoT problems deal with massive amounts of data with critical
challenges such as complex and dynamic search spaces, multiple objectives and constraints,
uncertainty, and noise that require an efficient optimizer to extract valuable insights. Grey wolf
optimizer (GWO) is an efficient optimizer stimulated by the hunting mechanism of wolves. The
increasing trend of applying GWO shows that although it is a simple algorithm with few control
parameters, it effectively solves optimization problems, particularly in various IoT applications.
Therefore, this study reviews applying GWO, its variants, and its developments in IoT applications.
This systematic review uses the PRISMA methodology, including three fundamental phases:
identification, evaluation, and reporting. In the identification phase, the target search problems
are defined based on suitable keywords and alternative synonyms, and then 693 documents from
2014 to the end of 2023 are retrieved. The evaluation phase applies three screening steps to assess
papers and choose 50 eligible papers for full-text reading. Finally, the reporting phase thoroughly
examines and synthesizes the 50 eligible articles to identify key themes related to GWOs in IoT
applications. The eligible GWOs are reviewed in the development, commercial, consumer, and
industrial categories. The paper visualized the spreading of eligible GWOs according to their
publisher, application, journal, and country and then suggested future directions for research.

## Excel file
This repository contains an Excel output file that encompasses the results of all the analyses conducted within the framework of the adapted PRISMA methodology. The Excel file provides a comprehensive summary of the findings from the systematic review.

The Excel output file includes the following Sheets:
